COVID-19 in Patients From Chest X-Ray Images Using CNN-Deep Learning
In this project, we explored X-ray images as doctors frequently use X- rays and CT scans to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and/or enlarged lymph nodes and try to detect positive COVID-19 cases from the given X- ray dataset.
